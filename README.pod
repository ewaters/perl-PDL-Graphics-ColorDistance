PDL::Graphics::ColorDistance

=head1 VERSION

0.0.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a PDL implementation of the CIEDE2000 color difference formula.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use PDL::LiteF;
    use PDL::Graphics::ColorDistance;

    my $lab1 = pdl([ 50, 2.6772, -79.7751 ]);
    my $lab2 = pdl([ 50, 0,      -82.7485 ]);
    my $delta_e = delta_e_2000($lab1, $lab2);

    # $delta_e == 2.0425;

=head1 FUNCTIONS



=head2 delta_e_2000

=for sig

  Signature: (double lab1(c=3); double lab2(c=3); double [o]delta_e())


=for ref

Calculates the Î”E*00 (delta e, color distance) between two Lab colors

=for usage

Usage:

    my $delta_e = delta_e_2000($lab1, $lab2);



=for bad


If C<delta_e_2000> encounters a bad value in any of the L, a, or b values the input values will be marked as bad
