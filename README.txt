NAME
    PDL::Graphics::ColorDistance

VERSION
    0.0.1

DESCRIPTION
    This is a PDL implementation of the CIEDE2000 color difference formula.

SYNOPSIS
        use PDL::LiteF;
        use PDL::Graphics::ColorDistance;

        my $lab1 = pdl([ 50, 2.6772, -79.7751 ]);
        my $lab2 = pdl([ 50, 0,      -82.7485 ]);
        my $delta_e = delta_e_2000($lab1, $lab2);

        # $delta_e == 2.0425;

FUNCTIONS
  delta_e_2000
      Signature: (double lab1(c=3); double lab2(c=3); double [o]delta_e())

    Calculates the Î”E*00 (delta e, color distance) between two Lab colors

    Usage:

        my $delta_e = delta_e_2000($lab1, $lab2);

    If "delta_e_2000" encounters a bad value in any of the L, a, or b values
    the input values will be marked as bad
